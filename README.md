## What Gets Installed

When you install a skill, the manager:

1. Copies skill files (SKILL.md, references, assets) to `{config}/skills/{name}/`
2. Copies command files to `{config}/command/` (if the skill has commands)
3. Merges agent config into `{config}/oh-my-opencode.json` (if the skill defines an agent)
4. Tracks installation state in `{config}/.skill-manager.json`

Config directory is detected automatically: `.opencode/` (project-level, preferred) or `~/.config/opencode/` (global).

## Migrating from v4

v5.0.0 replaces the flag-based CLI with subcommands:

| v4 (old) | v5 (new) |
|----------|----------|
| `npx @nano-step/skill-manager` | `npx @nano-step/skill-manager install skill-management` |
| `npx @nano-step/skill-manager --update` | `npx @nano-step/skill-manager update` |
| `npx @nano-step/skill-manager --remove` | `npx @nano-step/skill-manager remove skill-management` |

Existing v4 installations are automatically migrated on first run.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build

# Test locally
node bin/cli.js list
node bin/cli.js install skill-management
node bin/cli.js installed
node bin/cli.js remove skill-management
```

### Adding a New Skill

1. Create `skills/<name>/` directory
2. Add `skill.json` manifest:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "<name>",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "description": "...",
     "compatibility": "OpenCode with ...",
     "agent": null,
     "commands": [],
     "tags": ["..."]
   }
   ```
3. Add `SKILL.md` with skill instructions
4. Build and test: `npm run build && node bin/cli.js list`
